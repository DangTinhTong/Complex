/*Complex numbers are numbers that contain two components: a real part and an imaginary part. If a is the real component and b is the imaginary component, this notation is used to represent the number:
    a+bi
 Write an Objective-C program that defines a new class called Complex. Following the paradigm established for the Fraction class, define the following methods for your new class:
 -(void) setReal: (double) a;
 -(void) setImaginary: (double) b;
 -(void) print;      // display as a + bi
 -(double) real;
 -(double) imaginary;
 Write a test program to test your new class and methods.*/
